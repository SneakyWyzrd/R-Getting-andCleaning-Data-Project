The tidy.csv dataset was created from data in "data/UCI HAR Data" directory to
provide a tidy and neatly formatted dataset for further analysis.

All information given by the original dataset is true. There were no changes to
any information in the dataset. The only processes that were done were to
combine data from different files in the dataset and removing any duplicates.

Used files from "data/UCI HAR Data" directory to create the tidy.csv dataset
